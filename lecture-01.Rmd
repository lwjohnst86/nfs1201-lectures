## 5 learning expectations for today:

> - Think *big* and *systemic* (this is *public* health nutrition), especially
for possible interventions
> - Identify what food insecurity really means
> - What limitations are there for the measurement and definition, and associated 
over- or under-estimation
> - Differentiate between prevalence vs number
> - How to predict household, community, city, or provincial food insecurity
rates and use that to create interventions

## But, before getting into food insecurity...

. . .

Access to adequate food is a fundamental human right[^accessFoodRight]

. . .

> The right to adequate food is realized when every man, woman and child, alone or
in community with others, has the physical and economic access at all times to
adequate food or means for its procurement.[^foodRight]

[^foodRight]: From the [FAO Right to Food](http://www.fao.org/righttofood/right-to-food-home/en/)

[^accessFoodRight]: Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by UN General
Assembly in 1948

# Household food insecurity: another window into problems of nutrition inequity in Canada

## 

> "Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic
access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and
food preferences for an active and healthy life"

. . .

- Individual/household level
- Society/food system level
          
## 

> Household food insecurity:
> 
> - Insecure or inadequate access to food due to financial constraints
> - Often called 'hunger'

. . .

## Measuring 'hunger' on national surveys:	

**1994---National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY)**: Has your
child ever experienced being hungry because the family has run out of food or
money to buy food?

**1996---National Population Health Survey (NPHS):** Which of the following best
describes the food situation in your household?

- Always enough food to eat 
- Sometimes not enough food to eat
- Often not enough food to eat

**1998---NPHS:** In the past 12 months, did you or anyone in your household

- Worry that there would not be enough food to eat because of a lack of money?
- Not eat the quality or variety of foods that you wanted because of a lack of
money?
- Not have enough food to eat because of a lack of money?

## Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)

- Conducted annually by Statistics Canada to monitor the health of the
population.
- Surveys a nationally representative sample of approximately 60,000 Canadians,
12 years of age and older
- Omits people living on reserves and in institutions, members of the Armed
Forces, and people who are homeless.

```

![Conceptualization](img/diagram-ConceptFI.png)

## Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM; on the CCHS since 2004)

18 questions, differentiating adults’ and children’s experiences over last 12
months:

- Worry about not having enough food
- Reliance on low-cost foods
- Not being able to afford balanced meals
- Adults/children skip meals
- Adults/children cut size of meals
- Adults/children not having enough to eat
- Adults/children not eating for whole day

> "Because there wasn't enough money to buy food?"

Note:  Prevalence estimates published by Statistics Canada and Health Canada
only include moderate and severe food insecurity.

## How do children experience food insecurity?

Current measures are based on adults’ conceptualization and assumes adults
manage household food situation, employing a sequence of strategies to minimize 
children’s experiences of deprivation.

But children also take part in household food insecurity:

- Awareness at cognitive, emotional, and physical levels
- Take responsibility for managing food resources
- Participate in adult resource management strategies
- Initiate strategies to extend existing food resources and augment them

. . .

Implications for food security measurement: *Survey module may be
underestimating the extent and severity of food insecurity experienced by
children and adolescents.*

## Health Canada’s coding of food insecurity[^hcCoding]

| Category | 10-item adult scale | 8-item child scale |
|:---------|:--------------------|:-------------------|
| Food Secure | 0-1 affirmed | 0-1 affirmed |
| Moderately food insecure | 2-5 affirmed | 2-4 affirmed |
| Severely food insecure | $\geq$ 6 affirmed | $\geq$ 5 affirmed |

Table: Food insecurity $\geq$ 2 affirmed in either category (not added together).

[^hcCoding]: [Determining Food Security Status, HC website](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/surveill/nutrition/commun/insecurit/status-situation-eng.php)

## USDA codings of food insecurity definitions[^usCoding]

| Category | 10-item adult scale | 8-item child scale |
|:---------|:--------------------|:-------------------|
| Food Secure | 0-2 affirmed | 0-1 affirmed |
| Low food security | 3-5 affirmed | 2-4 affirmed |
| Very low food security | $\geq$ 6 affirmed | $\geq$ 5 affirmed |

Table: Food insecurity $\geq$ 3 affirmed in either category (not added together).

[^usCoding]: [Food Security, USDA](http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/definitions-of-food-security.aspx)

## Levels of food insecurity[^proof2013]

![Categories of food insecurity for Canada](img/coding-FoodInsecurity-2013.pdf)

[^proof2013]: [Taken from the PROOF 2013 report](http://nutritionalsciences.lamp.utoronto.ca/resources/proof-annual-reports/)

## Why is marginal food insecurity it's own level?

Why is it/should it be distinct and not grouped with 'food secure'?

. . .

- Marginally food insecure households report conditions of reduced food access and
anxiety about the availability of food.
- Compared to food secure, they are more likely to show other indications of
material hardship.
- e.g., Marginally food-insecure families were more likely to have borrowed money
for rent; delayed bill payments and cancelled telephone, TV or internet services
as a way to free up money for food.[^litMargFI] 
- Research in Canada and the US suggests that a 3-category definition is most
appropriate because there are meaningful distinctions among marginal, moderate,
and severe food insecurity.[^litMargCateg]

[^litMargFI]: Loopstra & Tarasuk, Journal of Hunger and Environmental Nutrition,
2013

[^litMargCateg]: Coleman-Jensen, Social Indicators Research 2010

## Compared to scales of other countries[^otherCountries]

Comparing the experience of household food insecurity as captured across 22
scales and related ethnographies from 15 different countries:

Commonalities:  

- Uncertainty and worry about food
- Inadequate food quality
- Insufficient food quantity

. . .

Consequences (vs core elements) of the experience:

- Hunger and other physiological consequences: present on most scales
- Alienation[^alien]: absent 

Not on scales but recognized in ethnographic work:

- Social unacceptability

[^otherCountries]: Coates et al, J Nutr, 2006
[^alien]: Hamelin et al, 2002

<!-- you've probably already started to notice the difficulties in measuring
food insecurity, and what exactly that entails -->
				
## Limitations: HFSSM inconsistently conducted

Food security module is not always part of the common content, and on years when
it has been optional, some provinces and territories have opted out.

. . .

CCHS must underestimate the true prevalence of food insecurity in Canada because
this survey does not include people living on reserves, homeless people, and
residents in some remote locations.

## Limitations: Difficult/impossible to compare across years

| Survey | Measure | Prevalence |
|:-------|:--------|:----------:|
| 1994 NLSCY | Child hunger | 1.20% |
| 1996-97 NPHS | Household food insufficiency | 4.00% |
| 1998-99 NPHS | Worry, quality, quantity* | 10.40% |
| 2000-01 CCHS | Worry, quality, quantity* | 14.70% |
| 2004 CCHS (Cycle 2.2) | 18-items** | 9.20% |
| 2007-08 CCHS | 18-items** | 7.70% |

Table: Inconsistent measurement on early surveys means that prevalence estimates
    cannot be compared over time. (NLSCY = National Longitudinal Survey of
    Children and Youth, NPHS = National Population Health Survey)

*response categories differ, so not comparable.  
**differences in sampling limit comparability of the Food Security Module.

Note: Last two CCHS were moderate + severe only

## Limitations: Incomplete data on full picture in Canada

Two other population subgroups that are very vulnerable to food insecurity but
not included in national population health surveys:

- First Nations peoples living on reserves
- People who are homeless

### On-reserve First Nations

- Kangiqsujuaq, Nunavik, PQ, 2002: 40% of households food insecure
- Kugaaruk, Nunavut, 2001: 83% of households food insecure
- Fort Severn, Ontario, 2002: 70% of households food insecure

\centering
\image{img/overTime-Numbers-2012.pdf}
\column{0.4\textwidth}
In 2012, 12.6\% of Canadian households (1.7 million households, or 2.8 million
adults and 1.15 million children) experienced food insecurity (includes marginal).
\end{columns}

## Food insecurity in Canada vs the US (using US definition)[^proof2012]

![Food insecure children map of Canada by percent, 2012](img/map-FoodInsecurity-Child-2012.pdf)

## Nunavut Inuit Child Health Survey, 2007-08

Random sample of 388 Inuit children, 3-5 yrs

18-item food security module, Health Canada’s coding.

Results: 

- Household food insecurity: 70% 
- Child food insecurity: 56%
    - 31% moderate + 25% severe

## Food insecurity by province as a percent of total food insecurity[^proof2012]

![Food insecurity by province, as a percent](img/provinces-FoodInsecurity-Percent-2012.pdf)

## Food insecurity by province, by household count[^proof2012]

![Food insecurity by province, household numbers](img/provinces-FoodInsecurity-Numbers-2012.pdf)

## Composition of food insecure households[^proof2012]

![Composition of food insecure households](img/householdComposition-2012.pdf)

## Single best predictor of household food insecurity = income[^cchs2011]

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=7}
data.frame(
    Prevalence = c(46.2, 14.8, 6.4, 3.3, 2.0, 0.9),
    Income = c('$1-10', '$20-30', '$40-50', '$60-70', '$80-90', '$100+')
    ) %>% 
    mutate(Income = factor(Income, levels = unique(Income), ordered = TRUE)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(Income, Prevalence)) +
    geom_line(aes(group = 1), colour = 'NavyBlue', size = 1) +
    geom_text(aes(label = Prevalence), vjust = 0, hjust = 0, size = 3) +
    ylab('Percent Insecure (%)') +
    xlab('Household income (000s),\nadjusted for household size') +
    theme_tufte(base_family = 'sans')
```

Food insecurity captures material deprivation: Product of income (size,
stability, security), assets, savings, access to credit, shelter costs, other
expenses (food medication, debt, etc).

[^cchs2011]: Data from CCHS 2011.

## Household income-to-Low Income Measure (LIM) ratio[^proof2012]

LIM is 50% of median household income, adjusted for household size.

. . .

![Income by LIM ratio](img/incomeLIM-2012.pdf)

## Food insecure main source of income[^proof2012]

![Main income source](img/mainIncome-2012.pdf)

## Why are so many households reliant on employment incomes food insecure?

. . .

- Low-waged jobs
- Short-term, part-time employment
- Single (vs dual) earner households
- Greater vulnerability among workers who are visible minorities and those with
limited education[^litMinorities] 

Combined with: 

- Inadequate income transfers provided to supplement low employment incomes

[^litMinorities]: McIntyre et al, Public Health Nutrition 2014

## 4 predictors, other than income, consistently seen in population survey analyses[^predLit]

. . .

- Lack of home ownership
- First Nations, Inuit, or Metis status
- Lone-motherhood
- Reliance on social assistance

[^predLit]: McIntyre et al, CMAJ, 2000; Che & Chen, Health Reports, 2001;
Vozoris & Tarasuk, J Nutr 2003; Ledrou & Gervais, Health Reports 2005; Health
Canada, 2007; Tarasuk & Vogt, Can J Public Health 2009; Willows et
al, Public Health Nutr 2008.

## Our social safety net:
 
- A myriad of federal and provincial programs designed to support people facing
financial hardships, e.g. Employment Insurance, welfare, disability supports,
old-age pensions, subsidized housing, tax credits, etc.

- None of these programs are specifically designed to achieve household food
security, and they appear to yield very different results.

## 65% of households reliant on social assistance are food insecure

- Incomes fall below basic living costs in most jurisdictions.
- Limits on allowable assets mean likely no savings, so no capacity to buffer
sudden increases in expenses or interruptions in income.
- Most provinces *do not index* social assistance incomes to inflation.

. . .

**Being on social assistance almost guarantees food insecurity.**

## Why are social assistance recipients so vulnerable? 

Incomes fall below basic living costs in most jurisdictions, as evidenced by 
Nutritious Food Basket costing comparisons.

. . .

### The exception: Newfoundland and Labrador

- Poverty Reduction Strategy launched in 2006, tackling breadth and depth of
poverty. 
- Social assistance benefits were increased and indexed to inflation. 
- Asset limits and earnings exemptions were raised

## Benefits to senior citizens

7% of households reliant on seniors’ incomes are food insecure (2012)

- Compared to 11% reliant on employment and 65% reliant on social assistance

Seniors have:

- Guaranteed annual incomes (*indexed* to inflation)
- Drug coverage
- Transit subsidies
- 'Seniors day' discounts
- Often own their home

. . .

Turning 65 drops the risk of food insecurity in half for low-income
adults[^litSeniors]

## 5 learning expectations for today:

- Think *big* and *systemic* (this is *public* health nutrition), especially
for possible interventions
- Identify what food insecurity really means
- What limitations are there for the measurement and definition, and associated 
over- or under-estimation
- Differentiate between prevalence vs number
- How to predict household, community, city, or provincial food insecurity
rates and use that to create interventions
