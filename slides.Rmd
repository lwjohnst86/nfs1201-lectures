# Household food insecurity: another window into problems of nutrition inequity in Canada

## 

> Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic
access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and
food preferences for an active and healthy life

Individual/household level access + community/societal/food system level
          
## 

> Household food insecurity:
> - Insecure or inadequate access to food due to financial constraints
> - Often called 'hunger'

<!-- pause here, is hunger different from food insecurity? Why? -->

## Measuring 'hunger' on national surveys:	

**1994:** Has your child ever experienced being hungry because the family has
run out of food or money to buy food?

**1996:** Which of the following best describes the food situation in your
household?

- Always enough food to eat 
- Sometimes not enough food to eat
- Often not enough food to eat

**1998:** In the past 12 months, did you or anyone in your household

- Worry that there would not be enough food to eat because of a lack of money?
- Not eat the quality or variety of foods that you wanted because of a lack of
money?
- Not have enough food to eat because of a lack of money?

## Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)

- Conducted annually by Statistics Canada to monitor the health of the
population.
- Surveys a nationally representative sample of approximately 60,000 Canadians,
12 years of age and older
- Omits people living on reserves and in institutions, members of the Armed
Forces, and people who are homeless.

## Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM; on the CCHS since 2004)

18 questions, differentiating adults’ and children’s experiences over last 12
months:

- Worry about not having enough food
- Reliance on low-cost foods
- Not being able to afford balanced meals
- Adults/children skip meals
- Adults/children cut size of meals
- Adults/children not having enough to eat
- Adults/children not eating for whole day

> "Because there wasn't enough money to buy food?"

Note:  Prevalence estimates published by Statistics Canada and Health Canada
only include moderate and severe food insecurity.

## Conceptualization of household food insecurity underpinning HFSSM module

Graphic here?

- Anxiety
- Qualitative compromises in
food selection
- Quantitative compromises in
food intake, hunger

## Levels of food insecurity[^proof]

## Why is marginal food insecurity it's own level?

Why is it distinct and not grouped with 'food secure'?

. . .

- Marginally food insecure households report conditions of reduced food access and
anxiety about the availability of food.
- Compared to food secure, they are more likely to show other indications of
material hardship.
- e.g., Marginally food-insecure families were more likely to have borrowed money
for rent; delayed bill payments and cancelled telephone, TV or internet services
as a way to free up money for food.  (Loopstra & Tarasuk, Journal of Hunger and
Environmental Nutrition, 2013)
- Research in Canada and the US suggests that a 3-category definition is most
appropriate because there are meaningful distinctions among marginal, moderate,
and severe food insecurity.   (Coleman-Jensen, Social Indicators Research 2010)

## Health Canada’s coding of food insecurity[^hcCoding]

| Category | 10-item adult scale | 8-item child scale |
|:---------|:--------------------|:-------------------|
| Food Secure | 0-1 affirmed | 0-1 affirmed |
| Moderately food insecure | 2-5 affirmed | 2-4 affirmed |
| Severely food insecure | $\geq$ 6 affirmed | $\geq$ 5 affirmed |

Table: Food insecurity $\geq$ 2 affirmed

[^hcCoding]: [Determining Food Security Status, HC website](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/surveill/nutrition/commun/insecurit/status-situation-eng.php)

				
## USDA codings of food insecurity definitions[^usCoding]

| Category | 10-item adult scale | 8-item child scale |
|:---------|:--------------------|:-------------------|
| Food Secure | 0-2 affirmed | 0-1 affirmed |
| Low food security | 3-5 affirmed | 2-4 affirmed |
| Very low food security | $\geq$ 6 affirmed | $\geq$ 5 affirmed |

Table: Food insecurity $\geq$ 3 affirmed

<!-- While the US has language that includes marginal food insecurity, their 
methods haven't changed and they still use these categories -->

[^usCoding]: [Food Security, USDA](http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/definitions-of-food-security.aspx)

## Compared to scales of other countries

Comparing the experience of household food insecurity as captured across 22 scales and related ethnographies from 15 different countries:
Commonalities:  
Uncertainty and worry about food
Inadequate food quality
Insufficient food quantity

Domain recognized in ethnographic work but not represented on scales:
Social unacceptability

Consequences (vs core elements) of the experience:
Hunger and other physiological consequences – present on most scales
Alienation (Hamelin et al, ) – absent 
				
## Limitations: HFSSM inconsistently conducted

Food security module is not always part of the common content, and on years when
it has been optional, some provinces and territories have opted out.

. . .

<!-- Question: outside of the questions themselves, how accurate do you think
the HFSSM is at determining food insecurity> -->

CCHS must underestimate the true prevalence of food insecurity in Canada because
this survey does not include people living on reserves, homeless people, and
residents in some remote locations.

## Limitations: Difficult/impossible to compare across years

| Survey | Measure | Prevalence |
|:-------|:--------|:----------:|
| 1994 National Longitudinal Survey of Children & Youth | Child hunger | 1.20% |
| 1996-97 National Population Health Survey | Household food insufficiency | 4.00% |
| 1998-99 National Population Health Survey | Worry, quality, quantity* | 10.40% |
| 2000-01 Canadian Community Health Survey | Worry, quality, quantity* | 14.70% |
| 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey (Cycle 2.2) | 18-item Food Security Module** | 9.20% |
| 2007-08 Canadian Community Health Survey | 18-item Food Security Module** | 7.70% |

Table: Inconsistent measurement on early surveys means that prevalence estimates
    cannot be compared over time.

*response categories differ, so not comparable.
**differences in sampling limit comparability.

Note: Last two CCHS were moderate + severe only

# Food insecurity in Canada

## Household food insecurity in Canada (2012)[^proof]

![Food insecurity map of Canada by percent, 2012](img/map-FoodInsecurity-2012.pdf)

[^proof]: [From the PROOF project 2012 report](http://nutritionalsciences.lamp.utoronto.ca/resources/proof-annual-reports/)

## Children in food insecure households in Canada (2012)[^proof]

![Food insecure children map of Canada by percent, 2012](img/map-FoodInsecurity-Child-2012.pdf)

## Household Food Insecurity in Canada in 2012

12.6% of households reported some food insecurity.
4 million Canadians lived in food-insecure households in 2012.
This includes 1.15 million children (i.e., 1 in 6 Canadian children) under the age of 18.

## Experiences of food insecurity

Quebec adults’ accounts of their experiences of food insecurity:
a profound lack of food choice, monotony of diet
disruptions to familial dining patterns
need to engage in highly stigmatized means of food acquisition
strong feelings of powerlessness, inequity, frustration  alienation 
			

				(Hamelin et al., Soc Sci & Medicine, 2002)


## Food insecurity in Canada and the US in 2011

## Nunavut Inuit Child Health Survey, 2007-08
Random sample of 388 children, 3-5 yrs
18-item food security module, Health Canada’s coding.

Results: 
Household food insecurity: 70% 
Child food insecurity: 56%
     31% moderate + 25% severe food insecurity

In addition to income, 4 other predictors of food insecurity are consistently identified in multivariate analyses of population surveys:
Lack of home ownership
Aboriginal status
Lone-motherhood
Reliance on social assistance

Social assistance
65% of households reliant on social assistance are food insecure.  

Incomes fall below basic living costs in most jurisdictions.

Limits on assets mean no capacity to buffer sudden increases in expenses or interruptions in income.

Most provinces do not index social assistance incomes to inflation.

Benefits to senior citizens
7% of households reliant on seniors’ incomes are food insecure.

Seniors have guaranteed annual incomes, indexed to inflation, and

drug coverage, transit subsidies, ‘seniors days’ discounts, ….
